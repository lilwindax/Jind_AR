This repository contains the Unity code for the First-Aid AR and AI Training System, an application that guides users through the process of providing First-Aid assistance to casualties using advanced AR and AI technologies.

## Requirements
To run the application, you will need:
```
 - Microsoft HoloLens 1 AR headset
 - Unity game engine
 - HoloToolkit development toolkit
 - Midjourney AI image generation tool
 - Google Speech to Text API
 - D-ID AI facial animation tool
 - Windows Keyword Recognizer speech recognition library
```


## Getting Started
```
 - Clone this repository to your local machine.
 - Open the Unity project in the Unity game engine.
 - Import the HoloToolkit package into the Unity project.
 - Set up the speech recognition library and APIs in the Unity project.
 - Build and deploy the application to the Microsoft HoloLens 1 AR headset.
```


## Usage
Once the application is deployed to the AR headset, users can put on the headset and launch the application. The system guides users through the steps of performing First-Aid using holograms and speech recognition. The photorealistic avatar provides natural-sounding voice prompts, which are synchronized with the avatar's facial animations to create a more immersive experience.

We would like to extend a special thank you to Red Cross New Zealand for their collaboration and support in this project. Red Cross provided us with invaluable First-Aid booklets that allowed us to base the content in our application on verified and authentic sources. Their support also allowed us to test and evaluate our system on medical manikins, which helped to speed up testing and evaluation and remove the dependence on human testers.
